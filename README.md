Timed Quiz

For this assignment, We were tasked with creating a coding quiz with a timer that deducts extra time everytime you get an answer wrong from scratch.

### Prerequisites

In order to take the quiz, you'll need a device with internet connection, and a browser.

## Getting Started

I've included screenshots of what the site looks like and all the pages you'll see as you progress through the quiz. The site is also linked below so feel free to take a look! 
Upon initially loading in to the site, you will see this:

If you then choose to click start, it will start the quiz and the page will change to display the first question:

Getting an answer correct or incorrect will display a small indicator message to tell you if you got the answer right or not:

If the timer were to run out, or if you finish answering all the questions, the page will change again, and you will then be presented with a prompt to enter your initials:

If you tried to proceed without entering your initials you'd encounter a small error message telling you to please enter your initials:

Finally, after entering your initials, you will then be taken to the high scores page where you will see the top 5 high scores. You can also access this page directly from the home page. You may even see your own initials being listed, if your score was higher than one of the ones currently on the list, or if the list had less than 5 entries:

From there, you can choose to either clear the high scores list, or go back to the home page.
